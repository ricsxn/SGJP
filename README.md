SGJP

Science Gateway Job Perusal

This service aims to monitor a set of given files produced by Grid jobs while executing into a ditributed infrastructure. Its principal aim is to monitor a given set of files while the job executes on the worker node. Beside this functionality the SGJP service may be used to retrieve in semi-realtime useful information about the executing job or be notified about any possible event while the job runs.
In science universe these functionalities above can be really useful understanding if an algorithm diverges or converges, obtain in semi-realtime execution statistics like file size progress, cpu percentage loud and possibly plotting these data into a chart. Users and communities could be automatically informed about the starting/stopping of long running job executions or for the accomplishemnt of intermediate computational steps and so on.
